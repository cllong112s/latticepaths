# latticepaths
This project deals with a combinatorial structure called lattice paths. The latticePath.h file will allow you to calculate paths with given steps and length. Special lattice paths can also be calculated, include Motzkin paths and Dyck paths. Containers and avoiders for each path can also be calculated.  I GUI is under construction right now that will allow you to graph each path, along with the containers/avoiders for that path. The GUI will be completed by 10/19/2020.
